# horiseon web developmet project
## Description: 
The motive was to alter the HTML and css into a more concise and user friendly web page 
this was done to meet accessibility standards in order to optimize the web page for search engines.
I learned that confidence is key, becomming a developer is difficult. The only way to improve is to have confidence in yourself as well as the infromation youve reatined in class.
I had no idea where to start in the beginning but I perserved and realized I knew more than I thought I did. Im not saying my work is perfect! But I feel better about coding, and am excited to continue learning new skills!
